# Titanic EDA and Visualization Project

## The purpose of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset and derive insights about the passengers and their survival rates. Tn this we have performed data cleaning, EDA, and create visualizations to better understand the data.

## The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset includes features such as:

- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).

- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- Ticket: Ticket number.
